                        <p> Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.</p><button type="button"onclick="alert ('A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website. Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website. Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web designer’s output is a site that wins and fosters the trust of the target audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration. Two of the most common methods for designing websites that work well both on desktop and mobile are responsive and adaptive design. In responsive design, content moves dynamically depending on screen size; in adaptive design, the website content is fixed in layout sizes that match common screen sizes. Preserving a layout that is as consistent as possible between devices is crucial to maintaining user trust and engagement. As responsive design can present difficulties in this regard, designers must be careful in relinquishing control of how their work will appear. If they are responsible for the content as well, while they may need to broaden their skillset, they will enjoy having the advantage of full control of the finished product.Web designers create the visual aspects of websites. They meet with clients, online or in person, in order to get a clear picture of the message that needs to be portrayed on the website. Once the details are determined, they create layouts, designs, and features that display the client services in a way that is appealing to the target audience.The aesthetic aspect is an important one and selecting the appropriate colors, font, layout and images creates the whole personality of the website. In addition to considering aesthetic aspects, the usability of the website has to be a priority — it is important to create pages that the target market can easily use')">Click Me!</button>

                            A Resturent management system (RMS) is the best online management platform
                            used for ordering food. The cloud-based software delivers large-scale
                            food,beverages and snacks . The main features of restaruent management system include its ease of use and many customization options. My major task was to design and develop the front-end of the Learning Management System from scratch using HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript, Nodejs and MySQL Database.</p><button type="button" onclick="alert('Phase 2: Adding web pages to the official Edufabrica website using Bootstrap. I was responsible for adding web pages to the company’s official website built using Bootstrap. Earlier I worked on the stagging site but later, I was allowed to work on the live site for spontaneous results and public feedback. I designed webpages for both Technical and Non-technical courses. I also worked with numerous.Bootstrap Plugins and themes which are used to add functionality and appearance to the website respectively. Along with these, I also did some debugging and troubleshooting tasks, managing the security and privacy of data on project management for the RMS Website.<bold>Phase 3: Making Landing pages:-</bold>A landing page is a page on a website with the purpose of converting visitors into leads.  This works by offering something valuable to the visitor, such as an ebook or free guide, in exchange for filling out a form that provides contact information.Landing pages are great for acquisition and can easily fit into your content strategy. If customers see a CTA . on one of your webpages, ads, or email, clicking on it should land them on a page that has an offer or services. <bold>Phase 4: Working on making Netflix Clone Pages</bold>Unlike TV,the Netflix clone script allows you the opportunity to watch the content in real time with the functionality to pause, resume a the impression of the on-demand entertainment apps on people’s lives has become more significant')">click me</button>

                        <p>App design is a combination of UI and UX design to build out a usable piece of software. Modern users don’t have patience for apps that are confusing to use. Ideal mobile app design is good-looking, functional, and straightforward all at the same time. So, how do you measure good app design? A good app is measured by good UX. Users should be able to navigate your application without needing to think. If they can instinctively figure out the design, they’ll continue to use your application again and again. In this article, we’re going to look at the 9 principles of mobile app design and how you can incorporate them into your design work.App design combines the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). While UI lends itself to the overall style of the app (including the colors, fonts, and general look and feel), UX focuses on the actual functionality and usability.<button type="button" onclick="alert('A large number of users abandon an app after using it for the first time. Since users are picky about which apps they use and so quick to abandon those they don’t enjoy, it’s essential to invest time and effort in creating a great user experience. The better the design, the better the chance that a user will engage with it and thus keep using it')">click me</button></p>
